# Hippocampus-Segmentation-and-Classification-in-Alzheimer-s-disease-using-Deep-CNN
To build a deep learning framework with CNN models that performs hippocampal segmentation and disease classification in Alzheimer’s disease


Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible brain degenerative disorder. Accurate early-stage diagnosis of AD is vital for the prevention and intervention of the disease progression.  Hippocampus is one of the first affected brain regions in AD. To help AD diagnosis, the shape and volume of the hippocampus are often measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Some automatic segmentation tools are already being used, but, in recent years, new deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proven to be much more accurate in various medical image segmentation tasks. In this project, we explore the well-known 3D U-Net, a type of convolution neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation tasks. The proposed method is evaluated on the task of hippocampus head and body segmentation in an MRI dataset, provided as part of the 2018 segmentation decathlon challenge. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms other conventional methods in terms of different segmentation accuracy metrics.
